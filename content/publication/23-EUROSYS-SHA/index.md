abstract: 'The memory demand of virtual machines (VMs) is increasing, while the traditional DRAM-only memory system has limited capacity and high power consumption. The tiered memory system can effectively expand the memory capacity and increase the cost efficiency. Virtualization introduces new challenges for memory tiering, specifically enforcing performance isolation, minimizing context switching, and providing resource overcommit. However, none of the state-of-the-art designs consider virtualization and thus address these challenges; we observe that a VM with tiered memory incurs up to a 2Ã— slowdown compared to a DRAM-only VM.
This paper proposes vTMM, a tiered memory management system specifically designed for virtualization. vTMM automatically determines page hotness and migrates pages between fast and slow memory to achieve better performance. A key insight in vTMM is to leverage the unique system characteristics in virtualization to meet the above challenges. Specifically, vTMM tracks memory accesses with page-modification logging (PML) and a multi-level queue design. Next, vTMM quantifies the page "temperature" and makes a fine-grained page classification with bucket-sorting. vTMM performs page migration with PML while providing resource overcommit by transparently resizing VM memory through the two-dimensional page tables. In combination, the above techniques minimize overhead, ensure performance isolation and provide dynamic memory partitioning to improve the overall system performance.
We evaluate vTMM on a real DRAM+NVM system and a simulated CXL-Memory system. The results show that vTMM outperforms NUMA balancing, Intel Optane memory mode and Nimble (an OS-level tiered memory management system) for VM tiered memory management. Multi-VM co-running results show that vTMM improves the performance of a DRAM+NVM system by 50%--140% and a CXL-Memory system by 16% -- 40%, respectively.'
